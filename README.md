# RSD_004_MapMyWorld
This repo is my submission to Udacity's Robotic Software Developer Project 004, entitled "Map My World".

In this project, we will create a 2D occupancy grid and 3D octomap from our simulated environment using the RTAB-Map package and use Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL) to localize the robot within the environment as we navigate via the TeleOp Twist Keyboard package.

The project must adhere to the [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2352/view)
